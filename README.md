# linc/steam_api
Steamworks SDK bindings for HXCPP and [Linc](http://snowkit.github.io/linc/).

## Preparations
1. Copy all `.h` files from `{Steamworks SDK path}/public/steam` to `{linc_steam_api path}/lib/steamsdk/include`.
2. Copy all files from `{Steamworks SDK path}/redistributable_bin` to `{linc_steam_api path}/lib/steamsdk/lib`.

Steamworks SDK is not available on public so you have to obtain it legally yourself.

## Current state
Draft as hell. Windows only at the moment. Not tested.
